Computational Practices HW1

From the original bubbles file, I made the bubble a lot smaller through adjusting the radius to 40px. I also changed the color of it through adjusting and playing with the numbers that control the fill of the bubble. To make the motion of the bubble more vigorous, I widened the amount of space the radius could fill up to (-4, 4), whereas it was (-1,1) in the original file. Additionally, I made it so that you could drag the bubble to wherever you want on the canvas through making it so that when clicked on, the bubble teleports to the mouse's location.
